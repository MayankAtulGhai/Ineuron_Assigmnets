But in Python 'None' object.In a python program, maximum of only one 'None' object is provided. One of the uses of 'None' is that it is used inside a function as a deafult value of the arguments. When calling a function, if no value is passed, then the default value will be taken as 'None'. If soem value is passed to the function, then the value is used by the Function. In Boolean expressions, it represents 'False'\n",

    "    * float- The float datatype represnts an floating point number. An floating point number is a number that contains a decimal point. For example- 55.89\n",
    "\n",
    "    * complex- A complex number is a number that can be in the form of a+bj or a+bJ. Here, 'a' represnts the real part of the number and 'b' represnts the imaginary part of the number. The suffix 'j' or 'J' after 'b' indicates the square root of -1. The part 'a' and 'b' may conatin integer or float. For example - 3+5j\n",
